# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Title: 

Jack Smallwood - This is my first project taking part in the University of Birmingham's Coding Bootcamp. The assignemnt is to refactor and make the code more semantic and follow the correct structure.

# Description: 

To take exisiting code and refactor it. Making it more semantic, follow the structured HTML & CSS flow. Also to enhance accesibility.

# Motivation: 

To make the more accessible, to refactor the HTML & CSS to have no effect on the working ability of the site but condense and promote better structure and flow to enhance SEO capabilities

# Actions Taken:

I have changed some of the div elements to better suited HTML tags. Using figure, figurecaptions, aside, article and footer for the reader to be able to better follow and read my code. I added a ID & class for the SEO navigation so it will take you to the correct part of the page on a click.

I have added the alt attribute to images to better explain what they contain.

I have also added comments to the style sheet for extra explanation of the use of the code and where it applies to. Also consolidated some of the CSS classes, grouping elements toghether without changing the functionality of the page

# Problems Solved: 

The code now has a more semantic HTML structure, allowing the reader to follow and read along. Condensing the CSS also allows the file to be less cluttered and more efficient. Ultimately allowing a better SEO optimization.
